I am a research associate in the [Cortical Processing Lab][0] at UCL.

## Signals: experiment control

I develop an open-source package for controlling neuroscience experiments called _signals_. It uses a dataflow-style paradigm expressed in MATLAB code to allow concise and intuitive specification of stimulus presentation, task structure, and control of data acquisition. The [GitHub repository][1] contains code and some information (more documentation to come).
